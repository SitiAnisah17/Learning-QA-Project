# This folder contains the results of the Software Quality Assurance (SQA) project from the MySkill platform. 
This project was created as part of learning and hands-on practice related to the software testing process, testing documentation, and the application of good QA methods in system development.

Some of the key areas covered and applied in this folder include:

- Test case writing

- Use of testing tools (e.g., Postman, Selenium, JMeter, etc.)

- Bug reporting

- Testing results analysis

- QA documentation (such as Test Plans and Test Reports)

- Translated with DeepL.com (free version)

# Note‚ö†Ô∏è
If there are errors in the document writing, testing format, or QA method implementation, I am very open to feedback or corrections. 
Please leave comments, issues, or pull requests so that I can continue to learn and improve myself.

# Thank Youüôè
Thank you for taking a look at this project. This folder is part of my journey to understand the importance of software quality and the role of QA in ensuring reliable products. 
I hope you find it useful, and please feel free to discuss it further!
